    <img src="images/game.JPG" height="500">	    
    <h2> Whack-A-Minion is relatively similar to whack a mole, this is a fun halloween themed minion clicking game where we have 6 holes and in each hole a different minion appears each time. For each whack, the user earns a point and there is a restricted amount of time that the user can get whacks on. There is also a fun background music playing while the user plays, and at the end if the user beats the high scores, their name will be recorded on a leaderboard.
